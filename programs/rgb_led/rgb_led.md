### easy_example.py

Requires [rgb_led.py](../../libraries/rgb_led.py) library to be uploaded to pico.

Shows how to use [rgb_led.py](../../libraries/rgb_led.py) library.

### rgb_led_loop.py

Requires [rgb_led.py](../../libraries/rgb_led.py) library to be uploaded to pico.

Shows how to use [rgb_led.py](../../libraries/rgb_led.py) library in a more complex example.

Though this complex is still not as complex as original_example.py.
